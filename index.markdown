# About

I'm a Prager Assistant Professor in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University, funded by an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship.

I completed my PhD in 2021 at Stanford University under the direction of Lenya Ryzhik.

# Interests

Partial differential equations (PDEs) and probability: reaction-diffusion equations, stochastic branching processes, viscous conservation laws, stochastic PDEs

Mathematics and climate change: climate impacts on agriculture, quantitative scoping of negative emissions technologies
